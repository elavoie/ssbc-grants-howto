# How to Become an Effective Contributor through the SSBC-Grants Process

Author: Erick Lavoie

## Introduction

In October 2017, Dominic announced [the first large influx of money into the community as a grant from Dfinity](%Qmj97E3/i5EEp2c1rg/0sj5eaJP3YB682rJTvRWuvB0=.sha256). Since then we have gone through 9 rounds of proposals, discussions, and allocation decisions and [collectively funded 29 proposals](%Zr9Hsiadh8PNJM+rNYO1ZVVzhF3HR4mZgS8VvTKqCp0=.sha256).

Introducing money in a community relying mostly on volunteer contributions is a double-edged sword. One the one hand, it enables some members to focus more on their contributions and therefore significantly increases the reach of what can be collectively achieved. On the other hand, it also uncovers all sorts of implicit assumptions, thinking habits, motivations, and wounds around money, as well as questions of fairness and worthiness. As a consequence, the process and the people running it have found themselves in the cross-hair of plenty of drama that is having a large emotional toll on core contributors as well as the wider community.

With this guide, I want to make some underlying assumptions behind the process explicit (Part 1) and provide suggestions on how to participate as an Proposer (Noted Adventurer) (Part 2). That should make it more accessible and especially fairer to those who are not used to grant processes, as currently done in academia, non-profit, and philanthropic organizations. Hopefully, that can also serve to defuse potentially dramatic situations by serving as a reference for future situations. In turn, this will enable the community to spend less energy handling internal tensions and focus better on *changing the world* to make it a happy and healthy place for everyone.

## Part 1: What is the SSBC-Grants Process?

These explanations come from my personal observations of the *evolving community practices* of the last months. I also propose two new explicit phases, Acknolwedgment and Reflection, that were not part of the original definition of the ritual. These are up for discussion with the community. For the rest I hope I have correctly captured the intention of the current design. Here we go.

### Main Purposes

So far, proposals have been funded along two main directions. The first is technical and process-oriented, and is a reflection of the strong technical background of early contributors. The second is more cultural and people-oriented, and is the manifestation of the beginnings of a distinct culture.

#### Technical/Process-oriented

The current main technical purpose of the ssbc-grants process is to **improve the growth of the SSB ecosystem for everyone**.  In social terms, we hope to address the most critical problems that will enable:
1. applicability to more use cases;
2. easier adoption and on-boarding;
3. easier and more contributions by current and new members;
4. easier adaptation/improvement of the current tools;
5. easier development of new tools/protocols/libraries;
6. more efficient community processes;
7. a higher number of people to be supported by the community;
8. new revenue opportunities;
9. lesser expenses.

In engineering terms, we are looking for [second-order and third-order effects](http://www.dougengelbart.org/about/abc-model.html): improve the way we develop things (ex: provide better documentation) and improve the way we improve ourselves (ex: provide better community processes).  These second and third-order effects enable exponential results with a roughly stable amount of attention available per person. By intentionally leveraging these effects, our community will achieve much more than our current size and funding level may suggest.

For the technically curious, the conceptual underpinnings of that approach have been studied extensively by Douglas Engelbart, and allowed him and his team to do the [Mother of All Demos in 1968](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJDv-zdhzMY) to demonstrate collective capabilities that took more than 40 years by the entire computing industry to replicate. The approach is called [Bootstrapping](http://www.dougengelbart.org/).

Past examples of funded proposals that meet those criteria:
1. [Mix helps you build it](%vuDrVQQ8iIrfM6N5vN+7pjlc6pQLVYk7JYD6PBlHdRQ=.sha256), which supported new contributors that may need a little scaffolding to fully blossom as new contributors therefore enabling more people to contribute;
2. [vtduncan protocol documentation](%kmwd/+e8E6qO/54sBcL/hB1aV5w1GhpJIW/TgRsyBhk=.sha256), which makes the SSB protocol significantly easier to understand for those not well-versed in JavaScript. This in turn helps new implementations to be written in other languages;
3. [the collective Grant Writing proposal](%60jr5FFqOQnDBbLG+wMnvqcggPZhR5nR7sf9BQ7hf8U=.sha256), which at least will make new grant applications significantly easier to write and in the best case will bring new grants to support the community; 
4. [SoapDog client based on a Firefox extension](%3jagfOZ7C9g0DnUbb+eMULPYT5g3oRRS4cT5Hm9bC28=.sha256), which enables Firefox-based applications to be used and attract the Mozilla community;
5. [Andrestaltz Mobile application development](%u84HY3Wjyyjxn3XtUZtUJFWjSClxeXnMGofvCmXj2a4=.sha256), which allows Phone-native SSB applications that will reach mobile-first people.

#### Cultural/People-oriented

In addition to improving our community reach along a technical/process-oriented viewpoint, some grants are also awarded to create a more *livable communal cypherspace*.  Proposals along these lines are an expression of our nascent culture by creating a *joyful*, *safe*, *humane*, *respectful*, *caring*, and *humorous* cultural environment.  They create a distinctive *emotional reaction* to the tools and the community space they create. They hold the space for community members to be more *authentic* and *complete* as human beings. They foster an *oasis* for people that have felt abused by other exploitative platforms, so they can be *nurtured* back into health. They will also attract future community members that come from a non-technical background by resonating with their *spirit*.

Proposals along these lines so far have had a strong *artistic* element to them. For example:
1. Zach! [SSB Non-Dev Resources](%XqpQ9N5UAnOdBBw+8LRk+9TV5edOYjl9/s++h5HTvWw=.sha256) which produced “[The Future will be Technical](https://coolguy.website/writing/the-future-will-be-technical/collaborators-not-consumers.html)”, a colourful take on the future;
2. Angelica’s [artistic residency](%F84om+ILE7mhRePripNvTfIUPPKtN8f0wtqfnNNoNy0=.sha256), has produced [animated hermies](%muLMFIRjAuMiOs7gKGQrisWF9QEX7PjHJR7HrwmNbac=.sha256) that have gotten traction and made the experience of reading posts joyful and distinct from standard emojis.

So far, in sheer numbers, many more proposals have been made to improve the technical aspects of the ecosystem than the cultural. The ratio between the two kinds of proposals will evolve in the future as more resources become available. The ratio shall eventually reach a balance as the community grows and matures. Perhaps other dimensions for growth will also be included based on future reflections on the process.

### Non-Goals

The following situations are not fundable through ssbc-grants. Expectations along those lines will likely result in high amounts of frustrations and tensions between both the proposers and decision makers. In particular, ssbc-grants are not designed to:

1. Support you doing your favourite hobby or activity, if the main benefits will accrue **only to you**;
2. Support other projects with similar goals as SSB, if there are no clear collaboration points that benefit both;
3. Provide on-going funding for maintaining existing projects;
4. Support community members in times of financial needs, regardless of their proposed contributions;
5. Recognize and reward past contributions to the previous phases of SSB;
6. Support contributors in training with monetary needs.

For each of the previous situations, here are corresponding potential alternatives that may be helpful to you:

1. Work on something useful to others inside or outside the community and use your free time to work on your hobby/activity;
2. Ask for funding from elsewhere specifically for your project;
3. Apply for the Maintenance Fund. You will have to show that you are currently maintaining a critical part of the community infrastructure;
4. Reach for family, friends, or governmental support. Hopefully one day we will have a solidarity network and saving circles in place to help you;
5. Don’t do anything. You may obtain recognition and even rewards through the ssbc-chur program in time but you cannot ask for it. Other members of the community will choose to offer it to you if they find your contributions significant and notable;
6. Enrol in a school and propose SSB projects as part of some of your coursework.

In time it would be great if the SSB community could provide for all those unfulfilled needs but that will require significantly more resources than what we have currently available. That being said, *organizing new community processes to raise additional resources and address those needs* would make great ssbc-grant proposals and contribute to a more healthy community.


### Funding Round Process

#### 1. Call for proposals (Duration: 1 week)

In this phase, prospective proposers test the waters by submitting their proposal(s) to the community for early feedback and support.

Before the end of the proposal phase, each proposer may either:
1. submit the proposal for review, which implicitly implies they consent in the process
2. retract their submission.

Proposals that are not explicitly submitted for review before the start
of the community review are not considered for the next phases.

#### 2. Community Review (Duration: 1 week)

In this phase, the community reviews the different proposals in more details. At the end of this phase, the proposals are frozen and submitted for a decision.

#### 3. Decision

In this phase, a decision is made for which proposals are going to be funded based on the quality of the proposals and the number of funding slots available.

#### 4. Acknowledgment

In this phase, Proposers acknowledge the decision and express gratitude at
everyone who supported their proposal and spent time helping improve it. 

The funded Proposers follow through with the rest of the paperwork and get started as soon as possible. 

The others acknowledge the feedback they have received and propose concrete steps to improve their proposal for later rounds. This is the preferred outcome, especially if the proposal has received significant support in the community. Otherwise, they may also choose not to pursue it anymore and explain why.

#### 5. Reflection

In this phase, any tension that has arisen during the process is discussed. Suggestion for improvements are made for the next rounds. Participants needs that were explicitly expressed but cannot not be addressed within the process are redirected to other options. 

Things that went well and pre-emptively addressed tensions with a better outcome than previous rounds are recognized and celebrated. Learning from participants is also celebrated. 

### Consent

Members of the community that participate in the process **consent to its current structure and outcome**. Any disagreement about the process or suggestions for improvement should be **written down and shared in a separate thread during the Reflection phase**. Moreover, **the feedback cannot be used to reverse a past decision; it can only serve to improve future rounds**. This ensures the community keeps making progress by not locking on contentious issues while still offering a space for growth triggered by the tensions that arise.

### Roles 

The following roles do not reflect all the roles mentioned in the current [Grant Process document](https://github.com/ssbc/grants-process/blob/master/roles.md). I have chosen to focus on those that matter most to the majority of participants.

#### Proposer (Noted Adventurers)

Articulate and write a proposal for a *clear*, *actionable*, *useful*, *well-scoped* project. The project will be done by the proposer themselves and should follow the goals of the grant process. (More on writing good proposals later). Again, by submitting a proposal for review, they consent to the current process.

#### Supporter
1. reads current proposals;
2. expresses their support for the proposals they would like to see happen;
3. asks clarification questions;
3. provides suggestions for improving a proposal;
4. explains how the proposals might be useful to them and others.

The latter part is really important for two reasons:
1. it *confirms* the need the proposer *sensed*;
2. it provides *encouragement* to proposers to make progress towards their goal, even if they may not be funded in the current round.

By studying the proposals from many angles, supporters collectively provide a richer and more diverse assessment of proposals than what the Adjudicator may achieve alone.

#### Master of Ceremony (MC)

Leads the process by announcing rounds in advance, explaining their purpose and the actions expected from participants, solicit participation, and keeps the community on track to ensure we successfully come to the end of the funding round.

#### Adjudicator

1. collects the feedback from all the supporters; 
2. independently review each proposal in details;
3. make an accept/refusal decision that aims to reflect as many of the elements raised by supporters as well as a subjective assessment of whether the proposal is likely to achieve the goals of the ssbc-grants process;
4. finally provide feedback on how to improve each proposal. 

The decision of the Adjudicator is **final and cannot be appealed**.

#### Payout Clerk

Ensures the funded participants obtain their funding with their preferred mean of payment.

#### Clarifying Misconceptions About the Roles

##### Supporters

*Do not judge proposals*, especially those they do not support. *Only the adjudicator judges proposals*. This prevents bickering and the division of the community in political factions during funding rounds. Supporters help but do not replace either the proposers or adjudicator.

##### Adjudicator

The adjudicator *will be biased in their decisions by their own experience and priorities*. They should still strive as much as possible to reflect the community collective opinion, be fair, just, and tactful. But they should *not completely ignore their own judgement* about the proposals. As a chosen experienced community member, it is assumed that their personal judgement is valuable and a good reflection of the community values and priorities, especially when it comes to the difficult task of *refusing* a proposal for the current round. 

The role is *rotated* between experienced and recognized community members for multiple reasons:
1. it mitigates the potential negative impact of personal bias to give a chance for proposals that may never pass with a particular Adjudicator, even after improvements, to eventually pass with a different one; 
2. it decouples the role from the person to increase the community’s trust in the process;
3. it gives a chance to the person performing the role to recover from the stressful aspects of making judgments on other people’s proposals.

## Part 2: How can I participate as a Proposer (Noted Adventurer)?

Please start thinking about your proposal well in advance of the funding round you plan to submit in. That may mean, starting to think about it a few months before, in small bits from time to time. The more attention you put in articulating your proposal and sensing what is going on in the community, the higher the chances it will be supported and funded. The following suggestions may help you throughout the entire process to be more *effective*.

### 1. Find a Good Project

Not all projects are equally amenable to the current process. The first idea you had is also most probably not the best fit, but it is probably a good seed for one. Your job is to find the *diamond in the dirt* and *polish* it until it shines brightly. 

For technical projects, the best way to find a good one, in my opinion, is to start working on a general direction for improvement from an intuition of a perceived need in the community. The roadblocks that will appear and make it hard to achieve the goal are good candidates for proposals: most likely, *others also stumbled upon them and were blocked for insufficient time and resources to dedicate*.

For cultural projects, I have no personal experience and therefore little credential to talk about them. I would still guess you should start from an intuition of a *missing feeling* in the community experience and translate it into an *artistic medium*. Ask Zach! and Angelina for their own experience.

Either kinds of project may start as hobbies or activities that may only be useful to you. At that stage they are not good proposals. But you should still share about them in the #ssb-show-and-tell as soon as you have something to show. As you keep going on them and obtain feedback from others, you may find out you are not the only one who has a need for it. At that point, the *common part becomes a great candidate for a project proposal*.

### 2. Gather Community Support

If you shared early progress as suggested above, you already have the seed of support for your project. If you did not and worked for a while alone, it is now time to become *social again*. Share the current stage of your project, however imperfect it may be. You are fully aware of all its limitations and short-comings because it is so close to you and you may have lost track of what is actually interesting and moving about what you have done. So share anyway and trust others to come and cheer you up! 

As a side note, some criticisms may actually show up when you share. We are having ongoing conversations about the role of criticisms to improve projects to figure out where and when it is appropriate. But we are dedicated to creating a safe space to encourage people to share early and foster a positive and supporting experience, especially for those that may feel *insecure* doing so!

Read also about what others are doing and actively follow people doing and sharing related projects. Understand *where they are going* and what *commonalities* there might be with your own project. Offer encouragement of your own and support them *the way they would like to be supported*. This will create goodwill in the community and shows *reciprocity and interdependence* between members. The people you support this way are the most likely to support your proposal in return.

### 3. Write a Compelling Grant Proposal

Now it is time to *articulate* your proposal. In the end your written proposal should at least contain:

* **A clear and concrete outcome**: It must be clear when your project will be done and considered a success. A vague outcome is harder to sustain motivation for and derive concrete steps for actions. It also makes it harder for others to assess whether you are making progress. For example, *improving documentation* is too vague but *documenting in a graphical way all procedures of the core API*, is awesome (see vtduncan proposal for a great example).

* **Actionable steps by you**: Translate the goal you want to achieve in specific and smaller steps that need to be performed. Organize them in a timeline in order of dependencies if necessary. *You* must be the person who will perform those steps, or be part of a team that collaboratively does them.

* **Explanation of how it is useful to others**: Explain the context in which your project appear and what needs it may answer for other projects in the community. It is a great time to link to specific discussions you had with others in the community.

* **Appropriately-scoped activities**: Adjust the goal such that the necessary steps fit in the allocated time. The grants have been designed around a rough goal of 20 days of full-time work but you may stretch it if the funding is enough to support you for longer. However, the likewise expected completion of the project should not exceed a few months, even if only working part-time on the project. This ensures there is timely completion of the grants so we can assess the success of the program and show the wider world and the funders what was done with the money.

* **Preliminary results**: Show examples of past work outside of SSB you have done that is relevant. Show preliminary work within SSB you have completed in the two previous steps. These may be screenshots of a prototype, mockups of the envisioned UI, links to repositories of previous projects, series of posts detailing reports on completed steps, etc. This shows you are a *doer* and not only a *thinker*. It also increases trust that you will bring the project to completion because you were willing to do it even without money. Money then becomes a secondary element and an enabler rather than the main motivation, which otherwise will wane once it sits in your bank account.

After having done the best job you were capable of, *explicitly ask for feedback from others* on your proposal. *Listen closely* to the feedback you will obtain. Ask people to be *truthful* and *caring*, rather than nice. Then answer questions and clarify the proposal.

For people that more effectively do than explain, spending a few more rounds polishing the proposals will make the community experience of reading them better.

For obsessive-compulsive and perfectionists, your proposal need not be *perfect*, just *good-enough* (see below). Let go of it once you start worrying about comma order!

#### Clarifying Misconceptions about Grant Proposals

A proposal need not be *perfect* to be funded, in fact no proposal is. It only needs to provide a reasonable expectation that you, the proposer, will successfully complete it in a way that will be beneficial to others given the limited time and funding provided. 

*Proposals are not only judged by the content of the proposal*. The decision is also based on the community experience of interacting with the proposer in the past. The more evidence already exists in the community for that, the less you will have to explain. That is why you may see proposals by experienced members of the community that may be quite short while yours might require more details.

Moreover, the decision process will therefore favour proposers that publish more often and make various unrelated contributions to the community, simply because they are better known and trusted to do more contributions in the future.

Likewise, proposers that interact or have interacted little *with the community* or even voluntarily or involuntarily created toxic social interactions, will be put at a heavy disadvantage and face an uphill battle in getting their proposals supported and funded. They will have to provide more details and evidence that the outcome of the project *will be good for others*. This is *normal* and *healthy*. 

This does not mean potential proposers should avoid criticizing for fear of not being funded in the future.  Actually, good criticisms can be awesomely positive contributions to the community and result in increased trust in critics. But to achieve that outcome, criticisms should be *constructive* and be done at the *right time* to ensure they *improve the social dynamics*. **Providing good criticism is a skill that needs to be mastered.**

### 4. Receive a Decision

This is the most stressful part of the entire process for everyone, both Proposers and Adjudicator. A judgement on proposals is hard to formulate properly and especially hard to receive in case of refusals. But it is necessary that refusals may be given because they are key to our collective improvement and effectiveness. 

I personally spent the last 1.5 year having all three of my papers rejected (https://arxiv.org/search/?query=erick+lavoie&searchtype=all&source=header) and I still keep working on them mostly in isolation. The reactions I mention below are those that *I personally had in the past*. The challenges I mention are those that *I need to actively address*. Seeing them in others in the last months has made me fully internalize and accept the role of refusals and the challenges in bringing projects to successful completion. Hopefully, I will be able to share the lessons here and make it easier for others (but that will never be easy).

Both an acceptation and a refusal contain challenges, it is not easy for anyone. So we will cover both in turn.

#### What to do after an accept?

*Smile.*

Thank the community that supported and believed in you. 

*Now, this is only the beginning, it is time to get to work!*

Here are three of the main *challenges* you will have to face to bring back something good for others:
1. **Maintain your focus on your project**, regardless of whatever else will arise in your life, in the community, or in the world. You might have to adapt the rhythm to take care of external circumstances. You may have to revise the scope. You may have to take breaks. But you will have to come back to it until your are done.
2. **Develop your skills and understanding** until they reach the level needed to accomplish the task;
3. **Keep moving** even though at times it may feel like the hardest thing you have ever done and you are not sure whether you will make through it. You may even feel it is not even worth it anymore. *This is perfectly normal*. Breathe. Then make sure you are making progress, however small that is, every time you set yourself for the task. If that is not enough, *ask for support from other community members*.

Setting up a regular habit for when you will work on your project and when you will take breaks will make the previous challenges easier. But that will never be completely *easy*.

#### What to do after a reject?

##### Calm down

*Breathe.*

**Resist the envy to flee.** You may feel like it is the worst thing that ever happened to you and that you would prefer never having to face a similar thing again rather than going through the pain of the aftermath. *This is normal!*

**Resist the envy to fight.** You may feel like the world is completely unfair and the decision process is crooked and that it is your duty to overthrow it. How could THEY not understand? How could these other flawed proposals be accepted and not YOURS? *This is also normal!*

*Breathe again.*

Go for a long walk. Do a mediation session. Do your yoga routine. Knit. Cook. Whatever works for you. Then come back. I have a message for you.

This is not personal. Really. We LOVE you!

The rejection exists as **an opportunity to help you reach the next level of what you are capable of**. We believe you can do better and *we are here to help you*.

So after the dust settled, breathe again.

If you took time to do step gather community support, you already know that at least some people in the community are enthusiastic about your project. So the direction in which you are going is worthwhile! Your task is now to improve your proposal.

##### Focus on improving your proposal

Now read back through the feedback you have received focusing only on the *positive points*. Notice the things you did well. Reflect back on the efforts you put in to achieve that. Congratulate yourself on them.

Now read back through the feedback you have received focusing on the *points to improve*.  Read them from the *point of view of the person(s) who had to review your proposal*. Can you identify what might have created misunderstanding in your writings? Can you see what could be missing or improved?

Let that sit for a few days, then come back later.

Now identify concrete actionable things that you can do to:

1. improve your understanding of your project;
2. clarify your proposal;
3. remove unnecessary or minor elements to make space for additional material;
4. add missing elements;
5. better integrate it with other community initiatives;
6. make it more concrete.

Do them, then ask for feedback from others. Ask them to be *truthful* and *caring*, rather than nice. *Listen closely*. Then rewrite. And rewrite again. And again.

##### Reflect

Now it is time to reflect. Compare your understanding of your own project with the one you had after the first version you wrote. Did you notice an improvement? 

Most likely yes! And this is why there was a rejection in the first place: **to make you experience this improvement so you could level-up!** That increases the chances that when hardship comes during your project *you will successfully come through it*. It also will also make the outcome of your project significantly *stronger and more useful to others*.

#### Clarifying Misconceptions about Refusals

 A refusal does not mean the proposal is not interesting and should *never* be funded again. It simply means one of two things:
1. it does not meet the evolving *minimum requirements* of the community, assessed from the point of view of the current Adjudicator, or
2. that there was a more urgent priority during the current funding round and not enough funding to support them all. 

A refusal should be presented and taken explicitly as an invitation to improve the proposal for a resubmission later, *especially if it fits the goals of the ssbc-grant process and gathered significant traction in the community*. 

Regardless of the reason for the refusal, reworking the proposal *will always increase its clarity, feasibility and strength*. So give it a shot before reapplying, that will also make it more interesting for those who will have to review it a second time. That will also publicly demonstrate your *dedication* to achieving it and increase everyone’s *trust in you*.

### 5. Follow Through / Reapply

If your proposal has been accepted, *maintain your focus, develop your skills, and keep moving*. Once you are 3/4 through the allocated time/funding you had given yourself go to step 6.

If your proposal has been rejected, **after having given a good shot at improving your proposal and letting yourself time to recover**, reapply in a later round, not necessarily the next. Every time you do it, you increase your skills and understanding and become a more *effective contributor*. Go to step 3.

### 6. Find a Sense of Closure

Reflect on what was achieved, what was harder than planned, and figure a good place to complete the project. Articulate the outcome *that was obtained for others*, share it in your dev diary, and finish what is necessary to make it *easily reusable*. **Document what was harder than previously thought and why**, so that others that try similar things in the future may learn from your experience and start from further than where you started from. That increases the likelihood we will collectively achieve your goal in the future.

### 7. Pay Forward

As a funded contributor you have been given a unique opportunity to work on your project. Remember that the **vast majority of the work in developing the infrastructure and community around SSB is voluntary and unpaid**. Therefore, think about ways to pay forward to others so that more people will have a similar chance. Figure out ways to bring benefits to others that won’t be funded so that everyone benefit from your presence. Share your experience, help improve the process, participate in one of the voluntary roles, and initiate new work that make the community healthier.

Thank you, it is awesome to have you among us!

## Conclusion

This document was prompted after a few sleepless nights trying to address the tension that has arisen in the July ssbc grant process. It took me many days and upward of 15 hours to articulate. Hopefully I have succeeded in making many assumptions behind the current process explicit, clarified and improved some parts of the ssbc-grant process, and provided ways for contributors to become more effective. We will also have it in time for the round in August.

In the future, we may improve this document as we go through and learn from more rounds of funding. We may also complete the document with additional guides for other roles that I have only briefly covered; *supporters*, *adjudicators*, and *master-of-ceremony* may also need more guidance in how to become more effective. By explicitly documenting the roles, we will make it more transparent to the rest of the community and increase trust in the process.

If you made it this far, thanks for your long attention span! We need you! Now I can go back to work on the other projects *I have to focus on*.
